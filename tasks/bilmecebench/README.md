# BilmeceBench: Turkish Cultural Reasoning Benchmark

### Description

BilmeceBench is a collection of traditional Turkish riddles designed to evaluate language models' cultural understanding and reasoning capabilities. The dataset contains authentic Turkish riddles (bilmece) that require both linguistic comprehension and cultural context to solve. Unfortunately, I currently lack the resources and time to conduct comprehensive model testing or evaluations, but users can utilize this dataset to perform their own testing and evaluations.

  Easy to verify for GRPO reward functions
