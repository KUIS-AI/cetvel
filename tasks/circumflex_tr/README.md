# Circumflex_Tr: Word Meanings with A and Â

**Circumflex_Tr** is a Turkish lexical semantics dataset focusing on minimal word pairs that differ only by the presence or absence of the circumflex accent (e.g., "kar" vs. "kâr"). The dataset aims to highlight how the circumflex can signal distinct meanings in otherwise orthographically similar word forms.

Word pairs are automatically extracted from an offline, open-source Turkish dictionary. Definitions are manually curated from the official <a href="https://sozluk.gov.tr/">Turkish Language Association (TDK)</a>, without the use of web crawling or scraping. Each entry includes both forms of the word and their respective definitions, enabling tasks such as text classification, word sense disambiguation, and linguistic analysis.
